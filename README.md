# OE4OOP
**An illustration of Object-Oriented Programming principles applied to Open Euphoria**

This project considers how the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can be applied/interpreted within the Open Euphoria (OE) environment.

The most important point is that OE4OOP **doesn't require** any supplementary libraries. It illustrates an *approach* to delivering the foundations of OOP in a systemmatic and consistent fashion.

The project sets out a template, through a small number of examples. A modular approach is adopted throughout, as this seems the most educative. A "class" module (extension *e*) is created and illustrated via a corresponding example (extension *ex*). The means of establishing inheritance are exemplified. Illustrations are included of constructors, and routine overriding and overloading.

Dot notation is not at present provided in OE, but OE4OOP offers an equivalent approach: the first parameter of every routine (qua "method") call is of the *type* (qua "class") instance. Included in the project, however, is a simple example of a pre-processor which enables applications (extension *dex*) cast in dot notation to be run in OE.

The author would appreciate feedback on these thoughts, whether of a critical nature or in relation to improvements, or refinements, in the approaches outlined.
